## Overview

This repository implements an Emotion Recognition system, likely using machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and classify human emotions from images or video streams. The main logic is contained in `emotion.py`, and there are directories for environment management (`my_env`) and archived resources (`archive`).

## Main Components

### 1. `emotion.py`
- **Purpose**: Main implementation of the emotion recognition logic.
- **Likely Functions**:
  - Loads image/video data for processing.
  - Uses computer vision (possibly OpenCV, TensorFlow, or similar) to detect faces.
  - Extracts features and applies a trained machine learning model to classify emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
  - Outputs results, which may be in the form of labels, annotated images, or logs.
- **How to Use**: 
  - Run with Python: `python emotion.py`
  - Input/output specifics depend on the code (see below for more details if available).

### 2. `archive/`
- **Purpose**: This folder typically stores datasets, trained models, results from experiments, or deprecated scripts.
- **What to Check**: Look inside for any sample data, pretrained model files, or experimental results.

### 3. `my_env/`
- **Purpose**: Contains the Python virtual environment for the project.
- **Contents**: All installed dependencies and packages, including `pip`, `tensorflow`, etc.
- **Note**: Do not modify this folder directly. If missing, create a new virtual environment and install dependencies as required.

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Saronzeleke/CodeAlpha-Emotion_REcognition.git
cd CodeAlpha-Emotion_REcognition
```

### 2. Set up the Python Environment

If the `my_env/` folder is missing or you want to use a new environment:

```sh
python -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate     # On Linux/Mac
my_env\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Check for a `requirements.txt` file in the future, or install manually if not present:

```sh
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
# Add other dependencies as required
```

---

## Running the Code

```sh
python emotion.py
```

- **Input**: The script may prompt for data, or you may need to edit the script to provide input paths for images or videos.
- **Output**: Look for results in the console, generated images with annotations, or output files.

---

## Environment Details

- The `my_env` directory contains packages such as TensorFlow, pip, and possibly others as dependencies for emotion recognition.
- Do **not** commit changes to `my_env` to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude it if not already done.
